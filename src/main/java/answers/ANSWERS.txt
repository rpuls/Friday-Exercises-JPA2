 Describe how we have handled persistence in the last three semesters. The considerations should
include all relevant layers. File IO, Relational Databases, the browsers local storage and cookies on the
browser.

1. fileHandler with file reader and file writer, we have stored a dictionary in the weblanguage project, and
reloaded it again with the fileReader.

2. We have manually made datamappers for mySQL databases, which used to store data from webpages on the client 
side through a servlet and finally to the datamapper, which were also use to get data out of the DB.

3. We are now using JPA , using the entityManager class and persistenceUnit  to persist data.


 Explain the Pros & Cons in using an Object Relational Mapping Framework


 Elaborate on some of the problems a ORM tries to solve
Tires to minimize manual work, to save time/money/budget in programming projects, it also helps keeping
the oo programs consistent with the database, since the database is created from the oo blueprint, or
the other way around (entity class from database) - this keeps class file consistent with table.

 Explain how Inheritance in an OO language can be mapped to tables in a relational database
classes that inherits from a parent will as default be created as a single table, containing a tuple for each
class and a DTYPE column in the table with the name (sort of enum'ish) for each inherited class. Alternativly
we can  create a table for each child class, using annotations.
